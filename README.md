# booHouse

The booHouse is composed of 4 modules of 16 m2 each:
three on the ground floor and one the second floor.

The booHouse provides 96 m2 of living spaces, out of which 64 m2 are indoors and the other 32m2 provide an outdoor experience. This structure stores

4382.9 Kg CO2 = 4.39 tCO2/booHouse

For this demonstration, we focused on the frame and the floor made out of bamboo. Steel joinery (oversized fort his prototype) is intended to work a scalable solution, with which a 3-4 stories building can be supported. 

Therefore, this Carbon Negative booHouse is designed to give us a wide experimental range in the coming months. The plan is to store in it as much CO2 as possible for >100 years, at an affordable price, compliant with the building code and providing outstanding living conditions.

This is our first step to provide uplifting housing conditions to all Humankind, while stabilizing the Earth Climate.
